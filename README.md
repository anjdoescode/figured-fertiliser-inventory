# Fertiliser Inventory

This is a simple Laravel application built to handle stock requests from a Fertiliser Inventory. It works simply in a way that helps a user understand how much stock is available for use and how much the requested quantity costs.

## Getting Started
This project runs with Laravel v9.16 and PHP (>= 8.0.0).

To run it without local dependencies, use [Docker](#application-build-using-docker). The application utilises [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#installation) and has the necessary configurations.

### Application Build
After cloning the repository, get into project directory and run:

``` bash
# create .env file and do not forget to set your DB_PASSWORD
cp .env.example .env

# install composer
docker run -v $(pwd):/app composer install

# start sail
./vendor/bin/sail up -d

# set sail alias
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'

# generate application key
sail artisan key:generate

# build CSS and JS assets
sail npm install
sail npm run dev
```

### Database Setup

Run database migrations and populate the database with existing inventory movements records.

``` bash
# migrate
sail artisan migrate

# seed
sail artisan db:seed
```

### Application Run
Go to http://localhost in order to see the application running.
